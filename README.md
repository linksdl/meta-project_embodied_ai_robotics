1, [A call for embodied AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03824)
> We propose Embodied AI as the next fundamental step in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence, juxtaposing it against current AI advancements, particularly Large Language Models. We traverse the evolution of the embodiment concept across diverse fields - philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and robotics - to highlight how EAI distinguishes itself from the classical paradigm of static learning. 

2, [A Survey of Embodied AI: From Simulators to Research Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04918)
> There has been an emerging paradigm shift from the era of "internet AI" to "embodied AI", where AI algorithms and agents no longer learn from datasets of images, videos or text curated primarily from the internet. Instead, they learn through interactions with their environments from an egocentric perception similar to humans. Consequently, there has been substantial growth in the demand for embodied AI simulators to support various embodied AI research tasks.

3, [Embodied Artificial Intelligence: Trends and Challenges](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-27833-7_1)
> The field of Artificial Intelligence, which started roughly half a century ago, has a turbulent history. In the 1980s there has been a major paradigm shift towards embodiment. While embodied artificial intelligence is still highly diverse, changing, and far from “theoretically stable”, a certain consensus about the important issues and methods has been achieved or is rapidly emerging.
